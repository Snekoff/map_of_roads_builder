Welcome to the fantasy world builder. If you want some fancy map with some kingdoms, towns even bandit camp you will got it.

The idea of this app to take some starting parameters or any and build a map with rivers, mountains, plain grass etc, and place some towns and villages on it. 
Every town or other point on map could possibly find usefull to start some relationship with another point. 
For example village produces ship fur and town making warm coats, then they are both interested in making a road between them to get welthier and popular.
But the road may be dangerous or even go through another point, these factors change the way road will be built.
By creating roads points gain wealth from selling and buying, and fame from people that traveled thro that points.
If point have enough "money" it can evolve or place some other points somewhere.

Evolution of this world goes through making relationship between points. And not every relationship is equal to all. Bandits will raid weak points, stealing at night or killing people.
But not only this scope will be having some changes. 
Each Point will have simmilar schema of evolving inside of it! Like in small town there will be butcher`s shop and the tavern, they will start to trade. 
The more road is used there are higher chance to level up it and bandits will be more attrackted to it.
On the other side Kingdoms will be set and start to negotiations between them even with armies.

So after N years of this evolution map_of_the_roads will give you alive world with huge ammount of coonections and points and places of interest which are common thing to attract travelers.
Any rpg game could use this world generator to have world be setted in no time. And keep all amount of info on each point, road or even square on the map.
