Welcome to the fantasy world builder. If you want some fancy map with some kingdoms, towns even bandit camp you will got it.

The idea of this app to take some starting parameters or nothing and build a map with rivers, mountains, plain grass etc, and place some towns and villages on it. 
For every town or for other point on map could possibly find it usefull to start some relationship with another point. 
For example village produces sheep fur and town making warm coats, then they are both interested in making a road between them to get welthier and popular.
But the road may be dangerous or even go through another point, these factors change the way road will be built.
By creating roads Points gain wealth from selling and buying, and fame from people that traveled thro that points.
If point have enough "money" it can evolve or place some other points somewhere.

Evolution of this world goes through making relationship between points. And not every relationship is equal to all. Bandits will raid weak points, stealing at night or killing people.

But not only "one kingdom" scope will be having some changes. 
Each Point will have simmilar schema of evolving inside of it! Like in small town there will be butcher`s shop and the tavern, they will start to trade. 
The more road is used there are higher chance to level up it and bandits will be more attrackted to it.
On the other side Kingdoms will rise at global map and start to negotiate even using armies.

So after N years of this evolution map_of_the_roads will give you alive world with huge ammount of coonections and points and places of interest which are common places to attract travelers.
Any rpg game could use this world generator to have world be setted in no time. And all amount of info on each point, road or even square on the map is kept inside.

Map *now* looks like this
